# Quick Actions UI Improvement

## Changes
- **Dashboard.js**:
    - Replaced the compressed 4-column grid with a spacious `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2` layout.
    - Updated button styling to be large, rounded cards (`rounded-2xl`, `p-5`).
    - Added the `action.description` text to provide context for each action.
    - Added a large, semi-transparent background icon positioned absolutely for a watermark effect.
    - Enhanced the main icon container with a larger size and subtle glass effect.
    - Improved typography for better readability and visual hierarchy.

## Visual Result
- The "Quick Actions" buttons now look like premium feature cards rather than small tooltips.
- They are fully responsive and show full text without truncation.
- The use of gradient backgrounds is preserved and enhanced with decorative elements.
